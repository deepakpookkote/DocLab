 ## Author & support
This project was created by [Deepak Pookkote](https://github.com/deepakpookkote) but i hope it will be improved by the contributors in coming days.

I love using my work and I'm available for contract work. Freelancing helps to maintain and keep (https://github.com/deepakpookkote/) up to date!
